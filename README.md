# 📊 Multi-Objective Optimization for Portfolio Selection  

**Authors:** Sara Gallego Villada & Hernán Octavio Moreno Mora  
**Institution:** Universidad EAFIT, Medellín, Colombia  

## 📌 Overview  
This project addresses the **portfolio selection problem** using **multi-objective optimization algorithms**.  
The main objective is to balance two conflicting goals:  

- 📈 **Maximize return**  
- ⚖️ **Minimize risk**  

To achieve this, we implemented and compared two well-known algorithms:  

- **NSGA-II** (*Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II*)  
- **MOEA/D** (*Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition*)  

The project includes theoretical background, mathematical formulation, and computational experiments using real financial data.

## 🧮 Methodology  

1. **Literature Review** – Portfolio theory, Markowitz model, and multi-objective optimization.  
2. **Data Collection** – Historical stock price data (2022–2023).  
3. **Mathematical Modeling** – Formulation of risk-return optimization problem.  
4. **Algorithm Implementation** –  
   - First implementation using MATLAB `gamultiobj`.  
   - Second implementation coding **NSGA-II** and **MOEA/D** from scratch.  
5. **Comparison of Results** – Evaluation of Pareto fronts, spread, and investment recommendations.

## 📈 Results  

- **Time Series Analysis** of selected assets.  
- **Pareto Fronts** generated by NSGA-II and MOEA/D, showing the trade-off between risk and return.  
- **Investment Portfolios** suggested by the algorithms, e.g.:  
  - Portfolio A: High-risk/high-return (large % in Tesla).  
  - Portfolio B: Balanced allocations among Tesla, Walmart, Amazon, etc.  

Some figures from the project:  

- Flowchart of MOEA/D algorithm  
- Time series of stock prices  
- Pareto front of NSGA-II and MOEA/D

## 🔍 Conclusions  

- Both **NSGA-II** and **MOEA/D** successfully generated **Pareto-optimal portfolios**, offering diverse investment options.  
- Results demonstrate the trade-off between **maximizing returns** and **minimizing risk**.  
- Although the algorithms are mathematically correct, their practical usefulness depends on the investor’s **risk tolerance** and **investment horizon**.  
- Future work: extend models with additional constraints (sector limits, liquidity) and incorporate financial fundamentals of companies.
